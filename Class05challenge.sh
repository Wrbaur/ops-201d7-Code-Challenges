# Purpose:                      Write a script that displays running processes, asks the user for a PID, then kills the process with that PID

#Display running processes
    while true; do 
        echo "Running processes"
        ps aux

        read -p "Enter the PID of the process to kill (or Cltr + C to quit): " pid
# Check for quit 
     #   if [[ "$pid" == "q" ]]; then 
      #      break
       # fi   
   # Kill the process with the given PID
    #kill -9 "$pid"
done
